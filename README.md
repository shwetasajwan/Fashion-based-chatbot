# 👗 AI-Powered Fashion Chatbot

An intelligent fashion recommendation chatbot built using Machine Learning to provide personalized style advice and answer fashion-related queries.
This project combines a trained ML model with a web-based interface to simulate real-world AI-powered customer engagement systems.

## 🔎 Project Overview

The chatbot is designed to:
- Provide personalized outfit suggestions
- Answer fashion-related questions
- Improve customer engagement through conversational AI
- Demonstrate integration between ML backend and web frontend
Unlike rule-based chatbots, this system uses a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for intent classification.

## 🧠 How It Works

1️. User enters a fashion-related query
2️. Text is preprocessed and vectorized
3️. Input is passed to a trained SVM model
4️. Model predicts the intent/category
5️. Appropriate fashion response is returned

## 🚀 Core Features

-  Personalized outfit recommendations
-  Interactive conversational interface
-  ML-based intent classification
-  Fast response time
-  Web-based UI integration
